Continuous integration:

1. Pre-deployment checks:
-- Code stability
-- Code quality
-- Unit tests
-- Code coverage
-- Security tests

2. Intermediate operations like artefact management and database versioning

3. Post-deployment checks:
-- Smoke
-- Regression
-- API tests

4. Intelligent notification management

5. Branching strategy



Code stability:
- Compilation
- Dependency validation

Code quality:
- Vulnerability
- Bugs
- Defects

(Developers spend 45% of their time fixing bugs or addressing technical debt vs building new features.)
